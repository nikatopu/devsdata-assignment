# Devtech Assignment

An assignment I was given by Devtech. This is a website which I had to build from scratch in 3 days. Even though I was given small amount of instructions and more free choice in design, I still wanted to make the whole website look like an actual finished product.

This website was built on SWAPI, the best star wars API.

To checkout the website, you can either download the files and open the index.html yourself, or just open the following link: https://nikatopu.github.io/devtech-assignment/
